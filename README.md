Previous reports from our lab show improved efficacy of Paclitaxel + MKC combination treatment as compared to Paclitaxel alone (on tumor volume, cell proliferation).

* Identify genes responsive to MKC treatment/ IRE1 inhibition. Candidates of being modulated by IRE1 activity.

* Identify changes induced by Paclitaxol treatment “reverted” by IRE1 inhibition.

* IRE1 inhibition impact on secretome. Changes in Transcription factors at early time point, changes in extracellular space annotated genes (secretome) at later time point.


Experimental design:

* Model: MDA-MB-231 (ATCC), breast cancer cell line (triple negative subtype). Cell line with high basal levels of IRE1 activity.

4 treatments/biological groups

* DMSO (control)

* MKC-8866 treatment (IRE1 inhibitor)

* Paclitaxol treatment (breast cancer chemotherapy medication)

* Paclitaxol + MKC-8866 combination treatment.

2 time points:

* 8 hours

* 24 hours

Single-end sequencing. 50bp read lenght.


As an alternative method to find genes responsive to IRE1 signalling, we set to identify genes whose expression pattern across the different biological groups are consistent with IRE1 regulation. That is, genes whose expression pattern significantly correlates with IRE1 signalling (positively or negatively) across the 4 conditions analyzed.
